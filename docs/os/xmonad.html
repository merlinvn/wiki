<p>
The xmonad executable is located in ~/.xmonad/. After upgrading xmonad, an old
executable might persist and need in that case be removed for xmonad to compile
a new executable. Alternatively use xmonad --recompile.
</p>

<p>
The recompilation can be automated by adding a pacman hook like the following
to /etc/pacman.d/hooks/xmonad.hook (you may have to first create the hooks
directory):
</p>

<pre>
[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package
Target = xmonad

[Action]
Description = Recompiling xmonad...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/sudo -u YOUR_USERNAME /usr/bin/xmonad --recompile
</pre>

<p>
Where YOUR_USERNAME is the username that you run xmonad from.
In the case that xmonad --recompile can't find any modules at all (including XMonad itself), try regenerating the package database cache
</p>

<pre>
sudo ghc-pkg recache
</pre>
