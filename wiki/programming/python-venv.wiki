Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a ./venv directory to hold it:

{{{
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
}}}

Activate the virtual environment using a shell-specific command:

{{{
source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, or zsh

. ./venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish

source ./venv/bin/activate.csh  # csh or tcsh
}}}

When the virtual environment is active, your shell prompt is prefixed with (venv).

Install packages within a virtual environment without affecting the host system setup. Start by upgrading pip:

{{{
pip install --upgrade pip

pip list  # show packages installed within the virtual environment
}}}

And to exit the virtual environment later:

{{{
deactivate  # don't exit until you're done with your work session.
}}}
