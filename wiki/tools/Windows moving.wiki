= Windows Moving in Vim =
* Some useful commands:
  * `CTRL-W r` Rotate windows downwards/rightwards. The first window becomes
    the second one, the second one becomes the third one, etc. The last window
    becomes the first window.  The cursor remains in the same window.This only
    works within the row or column of windows that the current window is in.
  * `CTRL-W Shift-R` Rotate windows upwards/leftwards.
  * `CTRL-W x` Swap current windowwith next one.
  * `Ctrl-W, Shift-H` - move this window to the far `left`
  * `Ctrl-W, Shift-K` - move this window to the `top`
  * `Ctrl-W, Shift-J` - move this window to the far `bottom`
  * `Ctrl-W, Shift-l` - move this window to the `right`
